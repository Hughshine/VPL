(** This is the main module of the VPL.
It defines what a polyhedron is and what operations can be done on it.
Not that there is no handling of the empty polyhedron (i.e. the bottom value):
a value of type [t] is assumed to be non-bottom and operators that may yield
an empty polyhedron have an [option] type as return value. *)

sets of constraints [s1] and [s2]. Either this intersection is empty, or it is
some new set of constraints [s]. The constructor [Contrad] represents the former
possibility, where the certificate gives a proof of the intersection being empty.
A value [Added (s, (fwd, bwd))] states that [fwd] is the proof of the intersection
of [s1] and [s2] being included in [s], while [bwd] is a proof of [s] being
included in the intersection of [s1] and [s2]. *)
